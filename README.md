# Open Contrail

OpenContrail is an Apache 2.0-licensed project that is built using standards-based protocols and provides all the necessary components for network virtualizationâ€“SDN controller, virtual router, analytics engine, and published northbound APIs. It has an extensive REST API to configure and gather operational and analytics data from the system. Built for scale, OpenContrail can act as a fundamental network platform for cloud infrastructure. 

There are some useful wikis, debugging techniques, architecutres documented in this repository. Hope OpenContrail users will find it useful.
